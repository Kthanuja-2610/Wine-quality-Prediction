# Machine Learning model to predict the quality of wine using Linear Regression
This repository contains the source code and also the resoucres for predicting the quality of wine using Linear Regession machine learning algorithm.Here,we are predicting the quality of wine based on various features of wine.
# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features.The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables.
# Advantages of using Linear Regression
Simple implementation: Linear Regression is a very simple algorithm that can be implemented very easily to give satisfactory results.Linear regression has a considerably lower time complexity when compared to some of the other machine learning algorithms.The mathematical equations of Linear regression are also fairly easy to understand and interpret.
Effortlessness and Interpretability: One of the key focal points of linear regression is its straightforwardness. The strategy is simple to get it and actualize, making it available to both fledglings and experienced examiners. Linear regression produces a straightforward equation that portrays the relationship between the subordinate and free factors.
